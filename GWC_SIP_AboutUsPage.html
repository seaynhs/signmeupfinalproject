    <h2>Audrey Roemer</h2>
    <img id = "ar" src="AudreyRoemerBioPic.jpg" alt="Audrey Roemer Picture">
    <p>Audrey Roemer is a rising Junior homeschooled student. <br>
      She spends most of her free time playing with her 3 cats, reading fantasy books, <br>
      singing (ABBA!) and dancing! After participating in the Stratton Branch GWC club, <br>
      she was happy to have the opportunity to learn more about coding, computer hardware, <br>
      and the tech industry as a whole through this Summer Immersion Program. <br>
      She is a major Trekkie and loves horror, sci-fi, and thrillers. <br>
      Her ideal way to spend her future days would be to code with her chubby, <br>
      adorable cats sleeping in her lap.</p>
    <p>   </p>
    <h2>Chelsea Yuan</h2>
    <img id = "cy" src="ChelseaYuanBioPic.png" alt="Chelsea Yuan Picture">
    <p>Chelsea Yuan is a senior at Northview High School, who attended Girls<br>
      Who Code because she believed that coding would be an important skill to <br>
      learn before pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering, although she neither likes<br>
      engineering nor wants to be stuck in the American education system. <br>
      She hopes to become powerful and successful in the future but is currently walking<br>
      on a very narrow, single-plank bridge to self-destruction. She fully sees <br>
      herself becoming an alcoholic by middle age and wishes to be immortal. Her ideal <br>
      way to die would be being torn apart by a black hole in the empty void of space.  </p>

    <h2>Kyra Jarvis</h2>
    <img id="kj" src="kyrajarvis.jpg" alt="Kyra Jarvis Picture">
    <p>Sixteen year old Kyra Jarvis has aspirations to be a great artist, <br>
      but a mediocre one isn't such a bad thought. <br>
      She spends most of her time reading and drawing elaborate stories of many characters.<br>
      She joined Girls Who Code in the summer of 2019 with the hopes of maybe learning something useful in the future, <br>
      but quickly realized coding is absolutely not her specialty and will continue to stick with the arts. <br>
      Example of her work in the background of this website! <br>
      If you are interested in her other works you can explore her Instagram @CasimirJarvis.</p>

    <h2>Morgan Burch</h2>
    <img src="MorganBurchBioPic.png" alt="Morgan Burch Picture">
    <p>Morgan Burch is seventeen year old Atlanta resident who helped create this project <br>
      because of her passion for technology, new languages, and the importance of accessibility. <br>
      For god knows what reason, despite having a background in film, television, and voice over, <br>
      Morgan plans to major in computer science. <br>
      This may be because her preferred way to be taken out of this world is to be murdered by a <br>
      robot of her own creation during the inevitable machine uprising.</p>
